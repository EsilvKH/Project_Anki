# Building and Launching the App

## Initial Setup:

This file describes how to build and launch the app. 

Start by opening two shells; one for running the backend and the other for the frontend.

## Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory: ./Project_Anki/Frontend.
Install dependencies: Run npm install.
Launch the frontend: Execute ng serve.
Access the app: Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will auto-reload on source file changes.

## Backend Setup:

Go to the backend directory: ./Project_Anki/Backend.
Install backend dependencies: Run npm install.
Start the backend server: Execute node ./server.js.
